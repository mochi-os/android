/**
 * Route constants and helpers for the chess Android module.
 *
 * Two top-level surfaces:
 *
 *  - [HOME] (`chess`) — class-level game list. Lands here when the chess
 *    launcher alias is tapped.
 *  - [GAME] (`chess/{gameId}`) — entity-context game detail. The detail
 *    screen pattern matches every other entity-context route in the
 *    Android client (e.g. `wikis/{wikiId}`).
 *
 * The detail screen itself is a stub in this wave — a separate agent owns
 * the board, engine integration, chat panel, and WebSocket wiring. The
 * stub gives the NavGraph something concrete to register so the rest of
 * the module builds cleanly.

/**
 * Register the chess routes on the supplied [NavGraphBuilder]. Called from

 * `*NavGraph` extension. Callback contract mirrors the other apps so the
 * host can wire the same `onLogout` / `onOpenNotifications` / `onOpenLink`
 * handlers it already uses.
 *
 *  - [onLogout] reserved for future use (the list screen overflow currently
 *    leaves logout to the menu shell, matching the pattern of wikis and
 *    feeds). Accepted now to keep the call-site uniform.
 *  - [onOpenNotifications] is a one-arg navigator into the lib's
 *    notifications inbox surface.
 *  - [onOpenLink] handles cross-app deep links — e.g. the new-game dialog's
 *    "Add friends" empty-state button jumps to the People app.
