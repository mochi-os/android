 * Inter, fetched from Google Fonts rather than shipped in the APK.

 * The four weights are downloaded and cached by the provider, so the app
 * carries no font asset. Two consequences worth holding on to:
 *
 *  - The first render on a cold install shows the platform font until the
 *    download lands, so type can visibly reflow once. There is no bundled
 *    face to fall back to, so what renders in the meantime is whatever the
 *    device calls its default.
 *  - A device with no Play Services - a de-Googled build, an emulator image
 *    without GMS - never resolves the provider at all and keeps that default
 *    for good. On those builds the type scale below still applies; only the
 *    letterforms come from the system. Bundling a face and listing it after
 *    the fetched weight here is what would close that gap.

/**
 * The Mochi type scale.
 *
 * Two deliberate departures from the stock Material 3 table, both aimed at the
 * flatness the default scale has on a dense productivity screen:
 *
 *  - Display and headline styles are Bold and title styles SemiBold, where
 *    Material leaves everything above bodyLarge at Normal. A screen whose
 *    heading is the same weight as its body has no entry point.
 *  - Tracking is negative on the large sizes and zero on body text. Material's
 *    positive body tracking (0.5sp on bodyLarge) is tuned for Roboto; carried
 *    over to Inter it reads loose and dated.
